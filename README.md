## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Research.git
    cd LLM-Research
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the dataset for training:
```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
